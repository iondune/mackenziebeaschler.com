  clear: yes
  body: >
    I worked at Tree Frog Treks from <strong>Spring 2013-Summer 2014</strong>. During the school
    year I acted as a teacher assistant in our after school programs. At nights
    and special events I would often take a lead role in discussing our animal
    ambassadors and talking about what our program offers. During the summer I
    was a co-lead in our summer camps. I have experience working with kids from
    ages 3-10. I mainly worked with a younger age group over the summer and the
    older kids in the after school programs and night events we had.

    I volunteered at the Aquarium of the Bay from <strong>September 2012-June 2014</strong>. I
    took care of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. I cleaned cages/tanks,
    regulated pHs, prepared diets, and provided enrichments. I have experience
    handling and feeding large predatory sea life (giant pacific octopi, moray
    eels, wolf eels, and younger sharks). I’ve assisted with checking bat rays
    for parasite loads using slide scrapings of their slime, routine check ups
    of our smaller sharks(leopard and spiny dogfish shark).

    I volunteered at the San Francisco Zoo’s Family Farm from <strong>June 2012-2013</strong>. I
    took care of a variety of farm animals. I enriched them, prepared their

- heading: Lab Assistant
  body: >
    I worked in Dr. Vance Vredenburg’s lab at SFSU from <strong>Fall 2011-Spring 2014</strong>. I
    assisted in multiple graduate projects by running samples and helping out in
    the field. In 2012 I swabbed preserved specimens at the California Academy
    of Science for a collaborative project between them and our lab. I acquired
    hands on experience interpreting data and running qPCR tests on swabs from
    all over the country.
