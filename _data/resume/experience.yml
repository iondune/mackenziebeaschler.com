    I worked at Tree Frog Treks from <strong>February 2013-August 2014</strong>. During the school
    year I acted as a teacher assistant in our after school programs. At nights
    and special events I would often take a lead role in discussing our animal
    ambassadors and talking about what our programs offered. During the summer I
    was a co-lead in our summer camps. I have experience working with kids from
    ages 3-10. I mainly worked with a younger age group over the summer and the
    older kids in the after school programs and night events we had.

    for parasite loads using slide scrapings of their slime and routine check ups
