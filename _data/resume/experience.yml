    I worked at Tree Frog Treks from <strong>Spring 2013-Summer 2014</strong>. During the school
    year I acted as a teacher assistant in our after school programs. At nights
    and special events I would often take a lead role in discussing our animal
    ambassadors and talking about what our program offers. During the summer I
    was a co-lead in our summer camps. I have experience working with kids from
    ages 3-10. I mainly worked with a younger age group over the summer and the
    older kids in the after school programs and night events we had.

    regulated pHs, prepared diets, and provided enrichments. I have experience
    handling and feeding large predatory sea life (giant pacific octopi, moray
    eels, wolf eels, and younger sharks). I’ve assisted with checking bat rays
    for parasite loads using slide scrapings of their slime, routine check ups
    of our smaller sharks(leopard and spiny dogfish shark).
