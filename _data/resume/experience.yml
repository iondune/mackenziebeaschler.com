- heading: Assistant/Lead Teacher

    I worked at Tree Frog Treks from <strong>Spring 2013-Summer 2014</strong>. During the school
    year I acted as a teacher assistant in our after school programs. At nights
    and special events I would often take a lead role in discussing our animal
    ambassadors and talking about what our program offers. During the summer I
    was a co-lead in our summer camps. I have experience working with kids from
    ages 3-10. I mainly worked with a younger age group over the summer and the
    older kids in the after school programs and night events we had.

    the field. In 2012 I swabbed preserved specimens at the California Academy
    of Science for a collaborative project between them and our lab. I acquired
    hands on experience interpreting data and running qPCR tests on swabs from
    all over the country.
