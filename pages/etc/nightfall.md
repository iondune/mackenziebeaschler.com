# Spybot: The Nightfall Incident

## About

Spybot: The Nightfall Incident was a one-off game made by LEGO to promote their spybot products. For
some reason I really enjoyed the gameplay, and it has always stuck with me as a game to take inspiration
from in my own development. It's getting harder to find on the internet, so I've backed up a copy of
it here.

You unfortunately need Adobe Shockwave to play it (I told you it was old), but you can easily
install that using <a href="https://ninite.com/shockwave/">Ninite</a>.

## Further Reading

The <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nightfall_Incident">Brickipedia page about Nightfall</a> has a comprehensive list of the programs
in the game and some background information.

Michael Hammes over at Stuffer Shack shares my enthusiasm for the game and
writes about it in <a href="http://stuffershack.com/a-game-fondly-remembered-spybotics-the-nightfall-incident/">his blog post.</a>

Someone was working on <a href="http://www.exeneva.com/2013/08/cohack-a-reimagination-of-spybot-the-nightfall-incident/">a reimagination of the game</a>
back in 2013 but it appears that nothing came of it. There's also a more recent
<a href="http://www.exeneva.com/2014/08/reimagining-a-successor-to-spybotics-the-nightfall-incident-in-3d/">reflection post</a>.
