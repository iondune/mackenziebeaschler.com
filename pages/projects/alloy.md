# Alloy Renderer

## About

Using heterogeneous processing to render dynamic scenes - in the images below,
the red models are rendered on the GPU while the green models are rendered simultaneously on the CPU.
The project was mostly experimental, but it does enable some interesting capabilities such as
depth-aware transparency (as seen in the images of the green dragon).
