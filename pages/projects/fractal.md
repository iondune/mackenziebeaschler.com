<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Around 1980, a French mathematician named Benoit Mandelbrot first glimpsed the fractal which would later become his namesake at an IBM research center in New York. Now, more than 30 years later, modern computer hardware such as GPUs continue to open new doors for fractal exploration. The Mandelbrot set is found by taking the simple equation Z -> Z^2 + C and drawing a set of points C based on whether they "escape" (or, tend towards infinity). Points which stay cyclically bound in an infinite loop are colored black. Points which eventually fly out towards the infinite are colored red, blue, or white, depending on how long it takes for them to escape.

This straightforward algorithm creates a stunning fractal of infinite, mysterious, spiraling detail. No matter where you decide to look, smaller shapes and finer complexity emerge.

Presented today is a zooming video, starting at a view of the entire set and zooming in on smaller and smaller shapes until the computer is no longer able to differentiate the numbers since they are so infinitesimal. At this point the image becomes visibly blocky and eventually fades to a single color. The video took several hours for a network of 27 high-end computer workstations to render.
