# Portfolio

## About Me

I am a game software developer first and foremost. I first started programming in 2005,
making simple text-based adventures in a BASIC environment called BlitzMax. In 2007 I
started to pick up C and C++ and moved on to making 3D games using [Irrlicht][1].

In early 2012, I started using OpenGL in graphics classes at Cal Poly. I took a game
development course and ended up responsible for [rendering and core game engine components
on my team][hca]. The engine I developed on that project would later become [ionEngine][2] my
largest project and the basis for all other 3d applications that I work on.

I've worked on a variety of projects including:

+ [A massively parallel and distributed fractal renderer using CUDA and OpenMPI][fractal]
+ [A level-sets surface reconstruction project][geom]
+ [A volumetric volume renderer for scientific data applications][vis]
+ [A CUDA-accelerated raytracer][ray]
+ [An oculus-rift enhanced racing game][rift]

Below is a demo reel of some of my more recent projects,
thought it's about a year out of
date. A more extensive and up-to-date
list of my projects is available on the [Projects][3] page.
