# About

## This Website

This website was made using [Bootstrap][1]
v3.1.1 with the [Lumen Bootswatch][2].

Apache URL rewriting was used in conjunction with some simple PHP scripting
to create a lightweight pseudo-CMS. The source code for this website is
open source and available [here][3].

The website source code is maintained under [Mercurial][4]
version control and hosted at [Bitbucket.org][5]</a>.
